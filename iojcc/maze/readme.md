# A MAZE <br>IS A MAZE

_once solved_<br>
_it will lead you_<br>
_to something bigger_

The maze creator by Martin Kleppe (twitter.com/aemkei) was written in JavaScript in a maze-like script. The original input is less than 140 bytes:

```
for(z=[i=991];i--;)z[i]=i%30?8:"\n";F=d=>[30,1,-30,-1].map((f,g,h)=>" "<z[f=d+2*h[3&g+i]]&&(z[f]=z[(d+f)/2]=" ",i+=7,F(f))),F(32),z+0
```

A version of the maze generator was used to create random variations of its own source until a valid script was found.

```
S="\40\n";M="map";i=991;for(z
=       [                   ]
;   i   ;   )z[--i]=i%30?   8
:   S   [           1   ]   ;
F=d=>   [30,1,-30   ,   -   1
]       [           M   ]   (
(   f,g,h   )=>S[0]<z   [   f
=   d                   +   2
*   h[3&g+i]]&&(z[f]=z[(d   +
f   )       /               2
]   =   S   [   0],i--,F(   f
)       )       )           ,
F(32);z+=S[1]//aem1k.com/maze
```

The resulting shape above has a 6x7 cell layout and will create a bigger maze with 16x14 cells.
